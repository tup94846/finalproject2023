# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO - Asteroid Destroyer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO #The game is bascailly moving your character and destroying asteroids. When you hit an asteroird you get points and if an asteroid hits you the game is over and it would keep what score you'll got and who ever got the highest score wins.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO #The project that I am doing is your classic old school arcade game. The 2D space motif of the Asteroids game program offers an engaging, interactive experience. Players use the arrow keys to steer a spaceship through an asteroid field that is created dynamically. To keep playing, your main goal is to stay away from collisions with the asteroids. When the spaceship reaches its limits, the software's wrap-around capability makes it appear on the other side of the screen without any trouble at all. The asteroid entities in the game have unpredictable spawn points and velocities, creating a dynamic and difficult environment. The game concludes with a win-or-lose scenario in the event that the player's spaceship collides with an asteroid. Python and the Pygame package enable the software to run, providing a flexible and easily navigable environment for game development. After installing the necessary dependencies, users can execute the script locally on their computers, offering a straightforward but entertaining gaming experience reminiscent of vintage arcade gameplay.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO You move your character and destroy the asetroid while moving around the asteroid because if you touch the asteroids your charcter would be destroyed.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO You get points while destroying the asteroids and you have 3 lives and you would continue on.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO Everything from  question 6 and 7 that I'm hoping would be the best outcome for my final project

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO The new skills that I would need another program in order for my game to be functional. The gaming code I would more likely to use is pygame since it was mention in class. It would be hard to code and downloading would be hard but I'll learn how to deal with it. I'm working on this project alone so I won't be working with any other classmates.
